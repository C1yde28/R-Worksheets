# Question 1: Shoe size and height data frame
# Create data frame with shoe size and height for males and females
library(openxlsx)

shoe_size_height_data <- read.xlsx(file.path("C:", "Rworksheets", "worksheet#4", "shoe_size_height_data.xlsx"))

df <- shoe_size_height_data

# a. Describe the data
summary(df)

# b. Subset by males and females
df_male <- subset(df, gender == "M")
df_female <- subset(df, gender == "F")

# Print male and female subsets
df_male
df_female

# c. Find the mean of shoe size and height
mean_shoe_size <- mean(df$shoe_size)
mean_height <- mean(df$height)

# Print the means
mean_shoe_size
mean_height

# d. Check relationship between shoe size and height (Correlation)
correlation <- cor(df$shoe_size, df$height)

# Print the correlation value
correlation

# A positive correlation suggests a relationship between shoe size and height.

# Question 2: Create a factor for months
months <- c("March", "April", "January", "November", "January", "September", "October", "September", "November", "August", "January",
"November", "November", "February", "May", "August", "July", "December", 
"August", "August", "September", "November", "February", "April")

# Create factor for months
factor_months <- factor(months)

# Print factor levels
factor_months

# 3. Summarize months vector and factor_months
summary(months)
summary(factor_months)

# The summary of the factor gives the count of each month, which is more useful than just summarizing the months vector.

# Question 4: Create a vector and factor for direction frequencies
direction <- c("East", "West", "North", "West", "West", "West", "North", "East", "North")
frequency <- c(1, 4, 3)

# Factor with a specified order
factor_direction <- factor(direction, levels = c("East", "West", "North"))

# Print new ordered factor
factor_direction

# Question 5: Import CSV file into R and view dataset
# a. Import the file import_march.csv
dataset <- read.table(file.path("C:", "Rworksheets", "worksheet#4", "import_march.csv"), header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# b. View the dataset 
head(dataset)

# Question 6: Exhaustive search
exhaustive_search <- function(num) {
  if(num < 1 | num > 50) {
    return("The number selected is beyond the range of 1 to 50")
  } else if(num == 20) {
    return(TRUE)
  } else {
    return(num)
  }
}

exhaustive_search(25)

    count <- count + floor(price / bill)

# Question 8: Student math scores
# a. Create dataframe from student grades

# b. Calculate average score of students with avg score > 90
for (i in 1:nrow(df_grades)) {
  avg_score <- sum(df_grades[i, 2:5]) / 4
  if (avg_score > 90) {
    print(paste(df_grades$students[i], "average grade this semester is", avg_score))

# d. Output highest score exceeding 90 for each student
for (i in 1:nrow(df_grades)) {
